IOT Interface with Memory Safe, Thread Safe and Concurrecy ABLE

This project proposes an interface for IOT built in a language that is memory safe, thread safe and concurrency able. Currently proposed in Golang.

This allows for Artificial Intelligence - AI, running on our stacks noted below. 

The protocol calls transparency in code within levels of the interface. 

The 3 tiers of security are noted as

1. Basic data exchange - Complexity of scripting and access is very limited.
2. Interactive exchange - Moderate ability to update each other with access minor processes interactively.
3. Dependency exchange - Deep reliance on resources of each other.

Within the second and third tier proprietary code submitted to the CFN IOT interface is subjected to decompiling for security assessment. 

Open source decompilers key to the process. Currently proposed for safe use within Containers for Golang to conduct remoted debugging protocols safely. A previously serious security issue.

This project further builds on our old stacks for multicore systems to run real time data analytics.

    • Keras Py
    • Apache Spark
    • Python
    • A virtualenv for Python with a scientific Python stack (scipy, numpy, matplotplib, pandas, statmodels, scikit-learn, gensim, xgboost, IPython + Jupyter notebook
    • R with a few packages installed (rmarkdown, magrittr,data.table, plus their dependencies). Plus SparkR & sparklyr for interaction with Spark.
    • Spark notebook Kernels for Python 3, Scala (SPylon) and R (IRKernel), in addition to the default "plain" (i.e. non-Spark capable) Python 3 kernel.
